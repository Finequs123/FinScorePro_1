Here is the **final, comprehensive Replit Engineering Instruction** for the **AI Scorecard Generator** module. This guide covers the **current bugs**, the **expected behavior**, and **enhancements** to be implemented, fully aligned with both your earlier document and the screenshots shared.

## ‚úÖ MODULE: AI Scorecard Generator

### üéØ **Purpose**

To allow users to define and generate an AI-based scorecard using pre-configured inputs and options. Output must be:

* Explainable,
* Accurate in logic (buckets, weights),
* Aligned with user preferences,
* Downloadable in proper PDF/Excel formats.

---

### üîß **BUGS TO FIX**

#### **1. Occupation Selection (Regression Bug)**

* **Problem:** Occupation field, earlier supporting multi-select, is now a dropdown (single selection).
* **Fix:** Revert to **multi-select with checkboxes or chips** as before.

#### **2. Missing Geography Field**

* **Problem:** Geography selection is missing from current UI.
* **Fix:** Restore geography field with dropdown/multi-select as per old implementation.

#### **3. Variable Band Score View Missing**

* **Problem:** Variable-level scoring (e.g., Age = 10%) is shown, but no breakdown by band (e.g., Age <18 = 0, 18‚Äì30 = 5, etc.).
* **Fix:** Add a second layer of band-based scoring UI for each variable:

  * Allow adding/editing ranges
  * Validate that sub-bands add up to total variable score

#### **4. Simulation Output Mismatch**

* **Problem:** Output of ‚ÄúLive Approval Simulation‚Äù not matching input target (e.g., target 20% ‚Üí output 65%).
* **Fix:**

  * Adjust simulation engine to calibrate using selected inputs and AI score thresholds.
  * Apply logic to match approval rate with predicted risk score distribution.

#### **5. Explainability Output Unclear**

* **Problem:** Explainability tab appears cryptic/technical (e.g., JSON-style, variables without readable logic).
* **Fix:**

  * Replace with human-readable scoring summary:

    ```
    Score = (Age Band: +10) + (Occupation: +8) + (Credit Score: +20) ...
    Risk Bucket: B ‚Üí Recommend
    Reason: Good repayment history, low FOIR
    ```

#### **6. Score Exceeds 100% on Selecting New Source**

* **Problem:** Total score weight goes above 100% when additional sources selected (e.g., Bureau, Banking, etc.).
* **Fix:**

  * Auto-adjust other category weights to stay within 100% OR prevent adding sources without redistributing.
  * Add real-time validation and warning.

#### **7. Output Downloads Not Working**

* **Problem:** PDF/Excel files either corrupt or fail to open.
* **Fix:**

  * Ensure:

    * Files are generated with proper headers, MIME types
    * Export includes all fields (variables, scores, bands, final bucket, explainability)
    * File download triggers after generation, not prematurely

### ‚ú® **FUNCTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS**

#### ‚úÖ **A. UI/UX Navigation**

* Use **wizard-style interface**: each tab must retain previous state when navigating forward/backward.
* Show breadcrumbs or tab steps clearly.

#### ‚úÖ **B. Tab-wise Breakdown of Functional Requirements**

##### **1. Product & Segment Selection**

* Support:

  * Multi-product selection (checkbox)
  * Segment type (e.g., Salaried / Self-Employed)

##### **2. Data Source & Quality**

* Selection of:

  * Source types: Bureau, Banking, Mobile, Employment, Application Form
  * Quality sliders: Completeness %, Accuracy %, Timeliness %

##### **3. Capability Matching**

* Show:

  * Which model/scorecard best fits the selected data quality and sources

##### **4. Weight Configuration**

* Support:

  * Total = 100%
  * Auto-normalize or manual override
  * Visual slider or numeric entry for each:

    ```
    Application Data: 25%
    Bureau Score: 30%
    Mobile Signals: 20%
    Employment: 10%
    Banking: 15%
    ```

##### **5. Variable View**

* For each source, list variables with total score (e.g., Age = 10)
* Add **band definition UI**:

  ```
  Age:
  - <18 = 0
  - 18‚Äì30 = 5
  - 30‚Äì60 = 10
  - >60 = 0
  ```

##### **6. Score Simulation**

* Preview:

  * Approval rate vs. target
  * Score distribution across buckets (A/B/C/D)
* Simulate with random or user-provided profiles

##### **7. Final Preference & Scorecard Generation**

* Capture name, owner, segment
* Allow Generate Scorecard action
* Save version (e.g., v1.0), support overwrite or clone

### üì• **EXPECTED OUTPUT (Downloadables)**

* ‚úÖ PDF: Summary of scoring logic, variables, weights, explainability, segment
* ‚úÖ Excel:

  * Columns: Variable | Assigned Score | Band Details | Comments
  * Optional: Include weights and segments

### üîê **VALIDATION RULES**

| Rule                        | Description                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Total Weight = 100%         | Cannot proceed unless total weight is 100%             |
| Band Sum = Variable Score   | Each band total should equal the parent variable score |
| Source Selection Constraint | Cannot add new source unless score is redistributed    |
