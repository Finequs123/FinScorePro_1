Here is the **“North Star Vision Note”** for Replit — crafted to give them clarity on the goal of the `AI Scorecard Generator` module while setting boundaries around changes:

---

## 🧭 FinScoreIQPro – AI Scorecard Generator Module

**Vision Note for Replit Developer Team**

---

### 📌 Background

`FinScoreIQPro` is an enterprise-grade credit scoring system designed for financial institutions. It has multiple modules — however, our current focus is exclusively on the **AI Scorecard Generator** module.

---

### 🎯 Objective

The `AI Scorecard Generator` is intended to allow users to dynamically create custom credit scorecards based on inputs such as:

* Product type
* Target segment
* Geography
* Data availability and quality
* Target approval rate
* Risk appetite

The system should then:

1. **Generate a dynamic scorecard** that reflects these selections.
2. **Run simulations** to estimate approval rates and risk.
3. **Provide clear AI rationale and recommendations** for tuning.

---

### ❌ Current Limitations

While the flow and UI steps are well-structured, the actual scorecard logic is currently:

* Not responsive to the inputs selected
* Not using any AI/ML to assign weights, score bands, or logic
* Not delivering actionable insights or simulation recommendations

Additionally, **some critical bugs** like scorecard export failure and non-functioning simulation logic exist.

---

### ✅ Our Plan

We are going to upgrade the module **step-by-step** using precise tasks, which we will provide **one at a time**. Each task will include:

* What to change
* What the expected output is
* Clear instruction to **not modify any other module, screen, or function**

---

### 🔒 Boundary Condition

> Please do not make any changes to other modules, code sections, or UIs outside of the task explicitly assigned.
> Unintended changes (like dropdowns turning into single-selects, or removed fields) must be strictly avoided.

---

### 🧱 Implementation Approach

You will receive **micro-level implementation tickets**, starting with:

* Fixing the scorecard export bug
* Adding bucket segmentation logic
* Enhancing simulation outputs
* And so on…

These will be shared only **after your acknowledgement** of this vision note.

---

### 👤 Point of Contact

The user will work with you directly and validate each task. No action should be taken unless explicitly specified in that task.

---

Let me know if you’d like any edits before we send this off to Replit. Once approved, I’ll prepare **Task 1: Fix Export Bug**.
