Final Enhancement Instructions for Replit (AI Scorecard Generator – Insights & Summary Screen)
Handle with extreme care – DO NOT modify any other screen, logic, or functionality outside the scope defined below.

🎯 Objective
Enhance the “Scorecard Insights & AI Summary” screen to correct minor display issues and add visual clarity without modifying any core scorecard generation or backend logic.

✅ MANDATORY FIXES (VISUAL + LABELS)
Fix Scorecard Spread (Simulated)

Issue: All score buckets (A to D) show “0% Approval”.

Fix: Replace static “0% Approval” with:

Either use actual bucket distribution from simulation output,

Or display message:
“Simulated spread shown for illustration. Actual score distribution available in Excel download.”

Top 10 Variables – Clarify Scale & Context

Add a short explanatory note below the chart:
“Variable importance reflects relative predictive strength used by the AI model.”

Category Weight Colors – Avoid Confusion

Ensure that each category has a distinct color hue.

Currently, both "Credit Bureau Data" and "Alternative Data Sources" are red.

Use visually distinct and colorblind-friendly palette (at least 7–8 hues).

Achieved vs Target Approval Rate

Ensure Achieved Rate shown here reflects actual simulated results.

If real value is unavailable, display a static placeholder with note:
“Approval rate shown for reference. Check Excel for detailed simulation.”

✨ OPTIONAL NON-BREAKING ENHANCEMENTS 
Variable Importance within Category (Drilldown Tooltip)

On hover over a variable bar, show a tooltip like:
“CIBIL Score contributes 45% of total Credit Bureau weight”

Download PDF Summary Button

Add a button next to Excel Download:
“Download PDF Summary”

Content: Snapshot of this visual screen with weights, importance, approval bars, and rationale.

Dynamic Rationale Enhancement (Optional)

Add a smart suffix to the AI rationale like:
“...based on selected sources, the model prioritizes Credit History and Income Stability for your Moderate risk appetite.”

🔒 Important Constraints (Do Not Violate)
❌ Do NOT change any logic used in scorecard generation, rule-based weight allocation, or final simulation engine.

❌ Do NOT touch Configuration screen, Category screen, or Export logic.

❌ Do NOT add new screens or steps — this enhancement is limited to Scorecard Insights & AI Summary page only.

Once implemented, please confirm:

All elements from above have been included.

Download Excel & JSON Summary still work without change.

Scorecard navigation is unaffected.
