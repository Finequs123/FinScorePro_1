Replit Developer Instruction — Final Resolution Prompt for AI Scorecard Generator
Hello Team,

This is a final comprehensive instruction to help you fully and finally resolve the issues in the AI Scorecard Generator module. Please read every part carefully.

The current state still breaks core functionality, even though Excel export is working. The scorecard generation logic and display are still incorrect and misleading.

🚨 Summary of Key Issue:
The scorecard creation flow (Steps 1–6) reflects all user selections (7 data sources, dynamic category weights, variable inclusion), BUT the final output in Step 7 and Excel download is:

Not reflecting dynamic categories or variables

Only shows 3 hardcoded categories, regardless of selections

Fails to generate JSON summary

This is a core functional bug, not a UI cosmetic glitch.

🔍 Step-by-Step Evidence (Attached Screenshots Referenced)
Step 1–6: User Selections

Product: Personal Loan

Segment: Salaried, Gig Workers

Geography: Pan India

Data Sources Selected: 7 (Credit, Income, Banking, Behavioral, Geography, Mobile, Utility)

Quality: Mixed (Always/Usually Available)

Model Confidence: Medium

Weight Config: All 7 categories with custom weights

Variables: 15+ mapped (e.g. Credit Score, BounceCount, Transaction Volume, etc.)

Scorecard Name: A22

Step 7 (Final Output):

Incorrectly shows only 3 categories:

Banking & Transaction History

Mobile & Telecom Data

Utility & Government Payments

JSON download fails

Excel only shows 7 variables — not fully mapped to original 7 categories

Live simulation works but rationale summary is misleading

🔧 Root Cause:
You are likely still pulling hardcoded categories from the backend or config file, instead of dynamically generating final categories from:

Step 4: Weight Configuration

Step 5: Variable Selection

Step 6: Score Simulation config

Additionally, the JSON logic is broken and AI rationale is not accurately mapped to what user configured.

✅ Functional Fix — What You MUST Implement Now
🔹 A. Dynamic Category Mapping (Critical)
Final output should only display the exact categories selected in Steps 2–4

Category names, weights, and variables must match what user configured

NO hardcoded fallback categories (Banking, Mobile, Utility) unless that’s all the user picked

🔹 B. Variable-to-Category Mapping
Each variable should be shown under the correct category with:

Variable name

Scoring logic (band/rule)

Weight within category

🔹 C. AI Rationale Text
Must dynamically reflect:

Selected data sources

Risk appetite

Geography

Avoid generic rationale like “Moderate risk appetite used...” — make it data-driven and personalized per scorecard

🔹 D. Simulation Consistency
Approval Rate shown in final step must match score buckets (e.g., A+B grades)

Default rate shown must reflect selected risk level

🔹 E. Fix JSON Summary Download
JSON must include:

Scorecard metadata (name, owner, creation time)

Full config (product, segments, data source quality)

All categories with weights and variables

AI rationale text

Simulation results (approval %, bucket distribution)

Variable-level rules (if available)

🔹 F. Edge Case Handling
If user selects < 3 categories, system must still show dynamic results

If user selects 7+ but weights only 3, only those 3 should appear

Don’t mix hardcoded logic with rule-based generation

🧪 How to Test / Replicate This Bug
Log in to [Demo Admin] and go to AI Scorecard Generator

Create a scorecard with:

Product: Personal Loan

Segment: Salaried, Gig

Geography: Pan India

Data Sources: At least 7 selected (varied availability)

Assign weight to all categories (e.g., 12% x 8)

Select at least 15 variables across all categories

Simulate at 20% target approval

Generate Scorecard

On final screen, check:

Are 7 categories shown?

Are all selected variables shown under correct categories?

Is the AI rationale text updated dynamically?

Does Excel match config?

Does JSON download?

Repeat with 3 and 5 category selection to test dynamic handling
